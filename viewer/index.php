An AI program, NewsFinder, crawls the web to collect stories that mention a few key terms, like "artificial intelligence" or "robot", parses them, scores them with respect to likely interest to readers, and publishes the highest scoring stories here. NewsFinder uses a Support Vector Machine that has been trained to classify the interestingness of stories (and is retrained frequently from readers' feedback) to score every story, then adjusts the scores up or down using knowledge of words and phrases that indicate more or less interest. </p>
